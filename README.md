# WHED API - Proof of Concept
This API is a proof of concept that a copy of the WHED can be accessed securely using an API, with user authentication and configuration of queries from the user. This is the capstone project for several students at the University of New England in Australia and is being developed in collaboration with the International Association of Universities and UNESCO.

## Setup
To run this project I'm using Flask, this will overwrite all of the .net work that has been done so far
