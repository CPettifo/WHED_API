# WHED API - Proof of Concept
This API is a proof of concept that a copy of the WHED can be accessed securely using an API, with user authentication and configuration of queries from the user. This is the capstone project for several students at the University of New England in Australia and is being developed in collaboration with the International Association of Universities.

## Setup
To run this project you'll need to have dotnet installed on your computer (found here - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download), as well as the MySql.Data package which can be installed with the command below once you have dotnet.

`dotnet add package MySql.Data`

I highly recommend using Git Bash (found here - https://git-scm.com/downloads) as you can run both git commands as well as standard bash commands on windows systems.
